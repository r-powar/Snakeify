# Snakeify


###How it works
    - The games starts once the browser content is loaded 
    - If the snake collides with the walls or with itself the game restarts with score reset 


##Improvements(Next Steps)
    - Would like to improve the start of the game by introducing a start button
    - Also allow for user interaction with the game, by letting the user pick the level of intensity (easy, moderate, hard)
    - Once the snake dies, show a popup(modal) with the score and a restart button
    - Improve on the shapes of the snake and snake food
